# https://appliedinteractive.com/blog/2015/09/15/how-to-choose-a-better-password-using-an-easy-algorithm/

#  Come up with a word you remember. Longer words are best, and phrases are even better. The word may be a dog or cat you had years ago, or even a street you lived on. For this example I will use a street I lived on: Mower Street.
#   Pick a number you can remember, such as the year you graduated high school. For this example, I will use the year I graduated from college: 1980.
#   Add a unique element to each password. For this example, I will use the first letter of the website I am going to use the password on. I will select A for Amazon.
#   Pick a symbol you will remember. Make sure it is readily available on your keyboard so you donâ€™t have to hunt for it. For this example I will use ^.
#   Lastly, decide the order. In this case, we will go in the order I listed the elements of the password: word-number-unique element-symbol.
